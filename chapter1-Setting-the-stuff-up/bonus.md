`class` - begins class definition, blueprint for an object;
`static` - indicates that variable or method belongs to the class, rather than any object created from the class;

`main` - main method is entry point of any java program, main method then calls the other methods requires to run you application;
`System` - class from core library, holds some useful methods and variables;
`out` - static variable within System which represents the output of the program;
